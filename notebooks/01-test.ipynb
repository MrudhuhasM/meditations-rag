That I did by \\ntimes prefer those, by whom I was brought up, to such places and dignities, which \\nthey seemed unto me most to desire; and that I did not put them off with hope and \\nexpectation, that (since that they were yet but young) I would do the same hereafter. \\nThat I ever knew Apollonius and Rusticus, and Maximus. That I have had occasion \\noften and effectually to consider and meditate with myself, concerning that life which \\nis according to nature, what the nature and manner of it is: so that as for the gods \\nand such suggestions, helps and inspirations, as might be expected from them, \\nnothing did hinder, but that I might have begun long before to live according to na-\\nture; or that even now that I was not yet partaker and in present possession of that \\nlife, that I myself (in that I did not observe those inward motions, and suggestions, \\nyea and almost plain and apparent instructions and admonitions of the gods), was \\nthe only cause of it. That my body in such a life, hath been able to hold out so long. \\nThat I never had to do with Benedicta and Theodotus, yea and afterwards when I fell \\ninto some fits of love, I was soon cured. That having been often displeased with Rus-\\nticus, I never did him anything for which afterwards I had occasion to repent. That it \\nbeing so that my mother was to die young, yet she lived with me all her latter years. \\nThat as often as I had a purpose to help and succour any that either were poor, or \\nfallen into some present necessity, I never was answered by my officers that there \\nwas not ready money enough to do it; and that I myself never had occasion to require \\nthe like succour from any other. \",\n",
